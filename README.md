The rise of Internet-of-Things enables the develop
ment of smart applications devoted to improving the quality of
 life in urban and rural areas, thus fostering the creation of smart
 territories.
 Some dislocated areas, however, are underprivileged
 in the provision of such smart services due to the lack, ineffi
ciency, or excessive cost of Internet access. To surmount these
 problems, some techniques related to opportunistic networking
 might come to aid.
 In this article, we propose a framework that
 is centered on relying on an untrusted Data Mule to carry data
 from an offline source to an online destination. In particular,
 we present a framework that enables communication between
 different actors and a reward mechanism for their work, based on
 the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies, Smart Contracts and
 Decentralized File Storages. The protocol involved in bringing
 a Clientâ€™s message online (and getting back a response) is
 thoroughly explained in all its steps and, then, discussed on the
 most important trust and security issues. Finally, we proceed to
 evaluate such a protocol and the whole framework through a
 series of communication latency tests, an analysis of the Smart
 Contract usage, and simulations in which buses act as Data
 Mules. Our results suggest the feasibility of our proposal in a
 Smart Territory scenario.
